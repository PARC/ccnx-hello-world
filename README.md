Building
-----

This code assumes an Ubuntu 14.04 with the CCNx distribution installed or
compiled.  It is meant to show a simple example of a makefile and the libraries
required to build a simple piece of software.

You will need to set the location of the CCNx libraries by setting the
`CCNX_HOME` environemnt variable.  If needed, the `LIBEVENT_HOME` environment
variable can be set to point to where Libevent has been installed.

To compile, type make.
